‌‌‌बर्याच वर्षानंतर, दाविद मरण पावला आणि त्याचा पुत्र शल्मोन हा इस्त्रायलवर राज्य करु लागला. ‌‌‌देवाने शल्मोनास दर्शन दिला व त्यास काय हवे आहे असे विचारले. ‌‌‌जेंव्हा शल्मोनाने बुध्दि मागितली तेंव्हा देव त्याच्यावर प्रसन्न झाला व त्याने त्याला जगातिल सर्वांत ज्ञानी मनुष्य बनविले. ‌‌‌शल्मोन अनेक गोष्टी शिकला व तो एक सुज्ञ न्यायकर्ता झाला. ‌‌‌देवाने त्यास खूप श्रीमंतही बनविले.

‌‌‌दाविदाने आखलेल्या योजनेप्रमाणे शल्मोनाने यरुशलेममध्ये एका मंदिराची उभारणी केली. ‌‌‌आता लोक दर्शनमंडपासमोर आराधना न करता मंदिरामध्ये अर्पण व आराधना करु लागले. ‌‌‌देवाची उपस्थिती त्या मंदिरामध्ये होती. देव आपल्या लोकांमध्ये वस्ती करु लागला.

But Solomon loved women from other countries. He disobeyed God by marrying many women, almost 1,000 of them! Many of these women came from foreign countries and brought their gods with them and continued to worship them. When Solomon was old, he also worshiped their gods.

God was angry with Solomon and, as a punishment for Solomon's unfaithfulness, he promised to divide the nation of Israel into two kingdoms after Solomon's death.

After Solomon died, his son, Rehoboam, became king. Rehoboam was a foolish man. All the people of the nation of Israel came together to confirm him as king. They complained to Rehoboam that Solomon had made them do a lot of hard work and pay a lot of taxes.

Rehoboam foolishly answered them, "You thought my father Solomon made you work hard, but I will make you work harder than he did, and I will punish you more harshly than he did."

Ten of the tribes of the nation of Israel rebelled against Rehoboam. Only two tribes remained faithful to him. These two tribes became the kingdom of Judah.

The other ten tribes of the nation of Israel that rebelled against Rehoboam appointed a man named Jeroboam to be their king. They set up their kingdom in the northern part of the land and were called the kingdom of Israel.

Jeroboam rebelled against God and caused the people to sin. He built two idols for his people to worship instead of worshiping God at the Temple in the kingdom of Judah.

The kingdoms of Judah and Israel became enemies and often fought against each other.

In the new kingdom of Israel, all the kings were evil. Many of these kings were killed by other Israelites who wanted to become king in their place.

All of the kings and most of the people of the kingdom of Israel worshiped idols. Their idol worship often included sexual immorality and sometimes even child sacrifice.

The kings of Judah were descendants of David. Some of these kings were good men who ruled justly and worshiped God. But most of Judah's kings were evil, corrupt, and they worshiped idols. Some of the kings even sacrificed their children to false gods. Most of the people of Judah also rebelled against God and worshiped other gods.
