\v 16 This is also what Yahweh said \add to the Israelite people:\add*
\q1 "Stand at the crossroads and look \add at the people who pass by\add*.
\q2 Ask them what was the good behavior \add that their ancestors had\add* long ago.
\q1 \add And when they tell you\add*, behave that way.
\q2 If you do that, you will find rest for your souls.
\q1 But you replied, 'We do not want to do that!'
\q1
\v 17 I sent \add my prophets who were like\add* \f + \ft metaphor \f* watchmen.
\q2 They said, 'Listen carefully when we blow the trumpets \add to warn you that your enemies are approaching\add*,'
\q2 but you said, 'No, we do not want to listen.'

\v 18 Therefore, you people in the other nations, listen to this:
\q2 Pay attention to what is going to happen to the \add Israelite people\add*.
\q1
\v 19 Listen, all of you!
\q2 I am going to cause disasters to happen to the Israelite people.
\q2 That is what will happen to them because they have refused to listen to what I told them.
\q2 They have refused to obey my laws.

\q
\v 16 Yahweh says this: Stand at the road crossing and look; ask for the ancient pathways.
\q ‘Where is this good way?’ Then go on it and find a resting place for your soul
\q But the people say, “We will not go.”
\q
\v 17 I appointed for you watchmen to listen for the trumpet.
\q But they said, “We will not listen.”
\q
\v 18 Therefore, nations, listen! See, you witnesses, what will happen to them.
\q
\v 19 Hear, earth! See, I am about to bring disaster to this people—the fruit of their thoughts.
\q They paid no attention to my word or Law, but they instead rejected it.
