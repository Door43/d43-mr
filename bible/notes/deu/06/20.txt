\v 20 When your son asks you in time to come, saying, "What do these things mean—the covenant decrees, the statutes, and the other decrees that Yahweh our God commanded you?"
\v 21 then you will say to your son, "We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt; Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand,
\v 22 and he displayed signs and wonders, great and severe, on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;
\v 23 and he brought us out from there, so that he might bring us in, to give us the land that he swore to our fathers.
