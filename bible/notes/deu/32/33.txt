===== Translation Notes: =====

Moses speaks a poetic song to the people of Israel. Moses continues to use parallelism to emphasize what he is saying. (See: [[:mr:ta:vol2:translate:figs_parallelism]])

Moses describes the future, that has not happened yet at the moment of his speech, but he describes it as the past.

From verse 34-35, Moses quotes Yahweh.

  * **Their wine is the poison of serpents and the cruel venom of asps - **  Moses continues this metaphor comparing the enemies of the people of Israel to grapevines to show that their fruits or actions were bad like the poison of serpents, like the venom of asps/cobras. (See:[[:mr:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
  * **Is not this plan secretly kept by me, sealed up among my treasures?**  - This is in a question form to emphasize that Yahweh's judgements are laid up in store with him, and sealed among his treasures/storehouse. AT: "This plan is secretly kept by me, sealed up among my treasures."  (See: [[:mr:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]]) (See: [[:mr:ta:vol1:translate:figs_metaphor]])
