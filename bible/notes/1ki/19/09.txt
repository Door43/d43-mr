\v 9 He went to a cave there and stayed in it. Then the word of Yahweh came to him and said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
\v 10 Elijah replied, "I have been very zealous for Yahweh, God of hosts, for the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, destroyed your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword. Now I, only I, am left, and they are trying to take my life, too."

    * **word of Yahweh came to him and said to him** - These two phrases share similar meanings and are combined for emphasis. AT: "Yahweh said to him" (See: [[:mr:ta:vol2:translate:figs_doublet]] and [[:mr:ta:vol2:translate:figs_metonymy]])
    * **What are you doing here, Elijah?** - Yahweh asks this question to rebuke Elijah and to remind him of his duty. AT: "This is not where you should be, Elijah." (See: [[:mr:ta:vol1:translate:figs_rquestion]])
    * **I, only I, am left** - Here the word "I" is repeated for emphasis. (See: [[mr:ta:vol2:translate:figs_hyperbole]])
